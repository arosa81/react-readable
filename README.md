# Readable: A Content and Comment Web App

## Project Overview
From Udacity:
> Leverage the strengths of Redux to build a “Readable” application where users can post text content and comment on each other's posts. You’ll build this dynamic application from scratch while combining the state management features of Redux with the declarative component model from React. When complete, you’ll be able to submit your own posts, comment on existing posts, and edit and delete posts and comments.

## Dependency
This app requires an Udacity provided backend API server: (https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter)
